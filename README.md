# Divider-Design
 Division of signed binary numbers is carried out in hardware

Design and implement a circuit to carry out division of two 8 bit signed binary
numbers represented in 2’s complement form. The results (8 bit quotient and 8 bit
remainder) are also to be expressed in 2’s complement form.
